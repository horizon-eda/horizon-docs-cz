Installation
============

So you wanna give horizon a test drive? Great! Here's how.

Windows
-------

Grab the latest build from `AppVeyor CI <https://ci.appveyor.com/project/carrotIndustries/horizon/build/artifacts>`_ 
and unzip it somewhere. Note that these are 64bit binaries. In case a
build is still running or someone broke the build, you can download past
builds from
`the build history <https://ci.appveyor.com/project/carrotIndustries/horizon/history>`_
(click on artifacts to get the zip)

Linux
-----

See :doc:`build-linux` for
instructions on how to build horizon on linux.
