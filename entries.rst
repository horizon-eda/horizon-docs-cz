Both point and comma are recognized as a decimal separator regardless of locale settings. By default all numbers are treated as millimeters. Suffixing a number with an ``i`` or ``in`` will treat it as inches. Use ``mi`` or ``mil`` to convert from thous.

Additionally, two-operand infix math is supported, so you can to this:

Addition: ``1+2``

Subtraction: ``1-2``

Multiplication: ``3*2``

Division: ``3/2``

Average :math:`\frac{ a+b }{2}`: ``3|2``

Adding mm and inch: ``1in+2mm``
