Example project
===============

Instead of starting your own project, you can also download the `design
files for an X-Band
transmitter <https://github.com/carrotIndustries/x-band-tx>`__. To open
it, point the project manager to the ``ddstx.hprj`` file. Make sure that
you extract all the files contained in that repository.
